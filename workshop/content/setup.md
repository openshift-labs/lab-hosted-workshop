Before starting on this workshop, check that you are logged in correctly and will be able to deploy applications. To do this run:

```execute
oc auth can-i create pods
```

Did you type the command in yourself? If you did, click on the command instead and you will find that it is executed for you. You can click on any command which has the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play-circle"></span> icon shown to the right of it, and it will be copied to the interactive terminal and run.

If the output from the `oc auth can-i` command is `yes`, you are all good to go.
