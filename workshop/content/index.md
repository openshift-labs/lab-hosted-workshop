The environment you are using is one of a set of applications useful in hosting training workshops. These can be supervised workshops run in a classroom like environment, or can be self paced workshops provided via an online interactive learning portal.

In this workshop you will learn how to deploy a hosted workshop for multiple users, in an OpenShift cluster setup for the workshop and where OpenShift users have been pre-created in the OpenShift cluster.

You will also learn what capabilities this type of deployment gives you and how to configure the deployment.
